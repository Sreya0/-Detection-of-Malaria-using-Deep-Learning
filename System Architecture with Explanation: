The VGG-19 architecture is a deep convolutional neural network that consists of 19 layers, including 16
convolutional layers and 3 fully connected layers. The network uses small filters with a size of 3x3 and
a large number of filters in some layers, which allows it to learn complex features. Here is a detailed
description of the VGG-19 architecture with a diagram:

Input layer: The input layer of the VGG-19 network accepts an input image of size 224x224 pixels.

Convolutional layers: The network has 16 convolutional layers, each followed by a Rectified Linear Unit
(ReLU) activation function. Each convolutional layer uses small filters with a size of 3x3 and a stride of
1. The number of filters in each layer increases as we go deeper into the network, from 64 filters in the
first layer to 512 filters in the last layer.

Max pooling layers: After every two convolutional layers, a max pooling layer is added to the
network. The max pooling layer has a filter size of 2x2 and a stride of 2, which reduces the spatial size
of the feature map by half.

Fully connected layers: The network has three fully connected layers, each followed by a ReLU
activation function. The first two fully connected layers have 4,096 neurons, while the last fully
connected layer has 1,000 neurons, corresponding to the number of classes in the ImageNet dataset.

Softmax layer: The output of the last fully connected layer is passed through a softmax function,
which produces a probability distribution over the 1,000 classes in the ImageNet dataset.
