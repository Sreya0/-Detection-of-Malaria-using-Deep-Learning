However, the researchers conducted their analysis using a dataset of segmented red blood cells, and they
were able to distinguish between malaria-infected and uninfected cells. The images were obtained by the
researchers from a collection of blood smear images of healthy and sick blood samples, which were
analyzed and compiled into a dataset. This dataset was used to train the researchers' deep learning
algorithm to reliably identify and categorize parasitized and uninfected cells. VGG16 is an object
identification and classification method that can classify 1000 photos from 1000 different categories with
an accuracy of 92.7%. It is a common picture classification technique that works well with transfer
learning.
