Malaria is a disease caused by Plasmodium protozoan parasites spread through the bites of female
Anopheles mosquitoes. 216 million cases were recorded in 91 countries, primarily in the African Region,
Southeast Asia Region, and Eastern Mediterranean Region. Symptoms include fever, tiredness, and
headaches, and early detection and treatment are essential. Diagnosing malaria is done by inspecting blood
samples for parasites, typically through light microscopy or rapid diagnostic tests. However, these methods
have limitations, including dependence on the pathologist's skill, the possibility of false-positive and falsenegative diagnoses, and being time-consuming. Malaria is preventable, but there is no effective
immunization available at this time

Deep learning algorithms, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), are commonly used in
computer vision and have become highly popular in evaluating and diagnosing biomedical and healthcare
problems. CNNs serve as automatic feature extractors, extracting hidden and important properties from
input data, and image categorization is achieved through a fully connected neural network. Machine
learning, including deep learning, is used in biomedical applications to assist physicians in making more
accurate diagnoses, improve patient care through personalized therapies, and improve human wellbeing.

Medical devices can produce vast amounts of data, and deep-learning algorithms can mine this data to aid
in the treatment and prevention of diseases and ailments. While deep-learning applications may appear
disillusioning to the general public, people knowledgeable in machine learning recognize their global
impact in resolving human problems across all fields.

It is true that malaria is a preventable and treatable disease that affects millions of people worldwide.
Microscopy is currently the most widely used method for malaria diagnosis, but it has limitations,
particularly in terms of accuracy and throughput. This is due to the fact that manual microscopy requires a
high level of expertise, which is often lacking in rural areas where malaria is endemic. To address this
challenge, researchers have developed automated systems based on artificial intelligence (AI) tools,
particularly deep learning techniques.

In this context, the authors of the study have developed a VGG-based model for recognizing infected
cells in malaria diagnosis. The VGG model is a convolutional neural network (CNN) that is widely used
in computer vision applications. The authors compared their model to previously developed models and
found that their model outperformed most of them in terms of accuracy metrics. The advantage of the
VGG-based model is that it has a relatively small number of layers, which reduces the computing
resources and computational time required.

Overall, the use of deep learning techniques in malaria diagnosis has the potential to improve the
accuracy and efficiency of malaria diagnosis, particularly in resource-limited settings. With further
research and development, AI-based systems could become an important tool in the fight against malaria,
ultimately saving many lives.
