Almost 500,000 people die each year from malaria, a deadly infectious disease caused by an infectious
agent. It is most often a delayed or incorrect diagnosis that causes these deaths. For diagnosing malaria, the
manual microscope is considered the most effective tool. However, it is time-consuming and prone to
human error. Due to the severity of the issue, the evaluation process must be automated. To eliminate human
involvement from the diagnosis process, this essay advocates for diagnosis automation.

A different approach to analyzing parasitemia in microscopic blood slides, which uses deep learning
techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), is to use deep learning technologies, such as
image processing, to improve diagnostic accuracy. Plasmodium parasites and erythrocytes are known to
vary in intensity characteristics, which are used in the method.

Convolutional neural networks, or CNNs, and other deep-learning technologies, such as image
processing, are being used to assess parasitemia in microscopic blood slides in order to improve diagnostic
accuracy. The method is based on the varying intensity features of Plasmodium parasites and erythrocytes.

Images of infected and noninfected erythrocytes are collected and input into the CNN models ResNet50,
ResNet34, VGG-16, and VGG-19, which were all trained on the same dataset. Transfer learning and
fine-tuning procedures are used, and the results are compared. Given the parameters and dataset that were
analyzed, the VGG-19 model had the best overall performance.
