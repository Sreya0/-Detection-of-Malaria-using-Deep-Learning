# Detection-of-Malaria-using-Deep-Learning
Malaria is a disease caused by Plasmodium protozoan parasites spread through the bites of female
Anopheles mosquitoes. 216 million cases were recorded in 91 countries, primarily in the African Region,
Southeast Asia Region, and Eastern Mediterranean Region. Symptoms include fever, tiredness, and
headaches, and early detection and treatment are essential. Diagnosing malaria is done by inspecting blood
samples for parasites, typically through light microscopy or rapid diagnostic tests. However, these methods
have limitations, including dependence on the pathologist's skill, the possibility of false-positive and falsenegative diagnoses, and being time-consuming. Malaria is preventable, but there is no effective
immunization available at this time
